                    A floating element must be placed as high as possible.
                    Rule 8 is, of course, subject to the restrictions introduced by the previous seven
                    rules. Historically, browsers aligned the top of a floated element with the top of
                    the line box after the one in which the image’s tag appears. Rule 8, however,
                    implies that its top should be even with the top of the same line box as that in
                    which its tag appears, assuming there is enough room. The theoretically correct
                    behaviors are shown in Figure 10-12.

                <p>
                    A left-floating element must be put as far to the left as possible, and a right-
                    floating element as far to the right as possible. A higher position is preferred to
                    one that is further to the right or left.
                    Again, this rule is subject to restrictions introduced in the preceding rules. There
                    are caveats here similar to those in Rule 8, although they are not quite so fuzzy.
                    As you can see from Figure 10-13, it is pretty easy to tell when an element has
                    gone as far as possible to the right or left.

                    A floating element’s top may not be higher than the top of any earlier floating or
                    block-level element.
                    Similar to Rule 4, Rule 5 keeps floated elements from floating all the way to the
                    top of their parent elements. It is also impossible for a floated element’s top to be
                    any higher than the top of a floated element that occurs earlier. Figure 10-9 is an
                    example of this; here, you can see that since the second float was forced below the
                    first one, the third float’s top is even with the top of the second float, not the first.

            <div class="col-3" style="position: absolute; font-size: 0.8em">
                When an element is positioned absolutely, it is completely removed from the docu-
                ment flow. It is then positioned with respect to its containing block, and its edges are
                placed using the offset properties ( top , left , etc.). The positioned element does not
                flow around the content of other elements, or vice versa. This implies that an abso-
                lutely positioned element may overlap other elements or be overlapped by them.

            <div class="col-3">
                With all of the positioning going on, there will inevitably be a situation where two
                elements try to exist in the same place, visually speaking. Obviously, one of them
                will have to overlap the other—but how does one control which element comes out
                “on top”? This is where the property z-index comes in.
            </div>
            <div class="col-3" style="position: absolute; font-size: 1.5em; z-index:2; background-color: azure; margin-top: 20px">

                <p>
                    As implied in the previous section, fixed positioning is just like absolute positioning,
                    except the containing block of a fixed element is the viewport. In this case, the ele-
                    ment is totally removed from the document’s flow and does not have a position rela-
                    tive to any part of the document.

            <h1>Values and Sizing</h1>
            <p>
                In CSS a relative length unit is one whose value is relative to another prop-
                erty. The two relative units in CSS2.1 are em , which is calculated from the
                font-size property of an element, and ex , which is calculated from the
                x-height of the element’s font (see “ font-size-adjust ” on page 56).
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="container" >
            <div id="rem">
                <h2>using rem</h2>
                <p>
                    If you presume that the root font-size of the document is the common
                    browser default of 16px, the first li element will have a calculated font-size
                    of 32px (16 multiplied by 2). But the font-size of the li elements nested
                    inside the first would be calculated relative to the inherited value, making
                    them 64px (32 multiplied by 2).
                    This is where the rem unit becomes essential.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>vmin vs vmax vs device orientation</h2>
                <p>
                    Another pair of supplemental units is available, too: vmax is equivalent
                    to whichever is the greater value of vh and vw , and vmin is equivalent to the
                    lesser value. For instance, if the viewport were 480×640, the height would
                    be greater, so vmax would be equivalent to vh , and vmin would be equal to vw .
                    Swap the viewport dimensions (640×480), and vmax and vmin reverse their
                    values.
                    So if you presume a viewport of 480×640, in the following code snippet,
                    element E is 640px wide, and element F is 480px wide:
                    E { width: 100vmax; }
                    F { width: 100vmin; }
                    The utility of vmax and vmin is in ensuring an element remains propor-
                    tional to the viewport regardless of orientation—useful when that orienta-
                    tion can easily change, such as on a mobile or tablet device.

            </div>
            <div style="font-size: calc(1rem * 1.5)">
                <h2>Using calc(x operand y)</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest changes in CSS3 lies in the way that lengths can be
                    declared. In CSS2.1, lengths are always a single value plus a unit, and if cal-
                    culations are required (say, subtracting the width of a border from a total
                    width), the developer has to do the calculation. But in CSS3, the browser
                    performs the calculations
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="viewportdim">
            <h2>Using vw and vh</h2>
            <p>
                A better solution is to use CSS3’s viewport-relative units— vh and vw —
                which represent viewport height and width, respectively. Each unit of value
                represents 1 percent of the appropriate viewport dimension: 1vh is 1 per-
                cent of the viewport height, and 1vw is 1 percent of the viewport width. For
                example, the following code makes an element 75 percent of the viewport
                width and 50 percent of its height:
                E {
                height: 50vh;
                width: 75vw;
                }
            </p>
        </div>
    </body>

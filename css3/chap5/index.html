                To display web fonts on your pages, you first need to define them by using
                the @font-face rule. This rule sets the name and type of the font and pro-
                vides the browser with the location of the file to use. Here’s the basic syntax:
                u
                v
                @font-face {
                font-family: FontName;
                src: wlocal('fontname'), xurl('/path/filename.otf') yformat('opentype');
                }
                I’ll break this syntax down a little. First, I give the font a name with the
                font-family property (u). This property is one you should be familiar with,
                although it serves a slightly different purpose inside the rule than it does
                when used in the declaration block for a regular selector; here, it’s used to
                declare a font name, not to refer to one. Just like the font-family property in
                CSS2.1, you can use multiple, space-separated words as long as you enclose
                them within single quotation marks.
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">
                Here, you can see that the first @font-face rule defines the font name
                as Gentium Basic (u) and gives the URL of the regular font face (v). The
                second @font-face rule uses the same font name (w) but adds the font-style
                property with the italic value (x), and the URL points at the font’s italic
                face (y). The italic style is applied automatically and appropriately, without
                your having to define it in the CSS, as in this example markup:
            </p>

        <div class="container">
            <div id="one">
                <h3>Div One</h3>
                <p>
                    This creates a block-level flex container; you can use the alternate
                    inline-flex value if you prefer an inline-level container.
                    Now you can add flex items to the flex container.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="two">
                <h3>Div Two</h3>
                <p>
                    The first step in using Flexbox is to create the flex container—the parent ele-
                    ment that will create a new formatting context for its contents. To declare a
                    flex container, you simply use a new value for the display property:
                    E { display: flex; }
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="three">
                <h3>Div Three</h3>
                <p>
                    A flex item is any child
                    of the flex container, which is subject to the formatting context created by
                    the container. For example, in the following code if #container is set as the
                    flex container, the two child items will become flex items:
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="four">
                <h3>Div Four</h3>
                <p>
                    When using Flexbox, you will almost certainly encounter situations where
                    the combined lengths of flex items along the main axis are greater or less
                    than the width of the flex container. When this happens, the “flexible” part
                    of Flexbox comes into play. Several properties allow flex items to grow or
                    shrink to fill their container. I’ll walk you through them in this section.

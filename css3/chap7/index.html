        <h1>Using Multiple Columns</h1>
        <div class="col-3">
            The element E is the parent of the content you want to divide, and the
            columns value is an integer that sets the number of columns. For example, to
            flow content inside a div element into two columns, you would use:
            div { column-count: 2; }
            Let’s move on to a real-world example. I’ll demonstrate a few para-
            graphs of copy displayed twice, the first distributed over two columns and
            the second over three columns. Here’s the code I’ll use:
            div[class*='-2'] { column-count: 2; }
            div[class*='-3'] { column-count: 3; }
        </div>
        <div class="splitter">
            <h4>And here is my splitter using col-span: all. The splitter has proven to be a very useful tool in the recent past</h4>
        </div>
